# A-novel-application-of-PLS-R-multimodal-predictions-in-healthy-aging
In our study, we predicted chronological age in a healthy lifespan
cohort (n=141; ages 20-86) from both neuroimaging and behavioural features. We
included measures of whole-brain cortical thickness, mean diffusivity and fractional
anisotropy (structure), resting state and task-based functional connectivity (function)
together with behavioural scores (behaviour). We reliably assessed prediction
performance of five different algorithms (general linear model; LASSO regression;
Random Forest; Support Vector Regression and Partial Least Square Regression)
through nested cross-validation and compared their prediction errors (mean absolute
error). We then tested our highest predicting methods on held-out clean and low quality
data. We further estimated the contribution of each modality (behaviour – function –
structure) to our age predictions in our best predictive model. Our analyses were first
carried out by including all our measures as predictors in our models (phase I) and
subsequently only neuroimaging scores (i.e., brain age) (phase II).
